I let all the "things" become an object and their are some content and method in it. Such as edit, delete , show etc.
I mainly use javascript to hadle the function need to do. Besides, I also use HTML5 for select date, and jQuery, CSS to 
let website more good-looking.

The problem I encounter is that I'm not familiar with jQuery so I spend some time to understand it.
And when I want to refresh website dynamically, it confused me to let right things show in right place.
